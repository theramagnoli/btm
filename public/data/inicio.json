Wonderful service from the day we jointly began planning our holidays - weeks in advance - with perfect execution on all four days we spent with Leo and Caleb; fantastic guides with whom we not only learned a lot of history and Mexican culture but had a lot of fun. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",

      "desc": "Aside from the wonderful staff, what also sets this company apart is their ability to get off the main tourist path and really give you up-close opportunities to experience the amazing culture and wonders of Quintana Roo. Swimming in and exploring beautiful cenotes as well as sharing an amazing meal at a Mayan family's home, will remain highlights of our trip to the Mayan Riviera. If you're looking for 1st class adventures near Playa del Carmen, give the wonderful staff at Boutique Tours Mexico a call. They are the best!",
